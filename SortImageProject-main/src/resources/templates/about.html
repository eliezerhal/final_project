        <div class="col-md-6 alert-info "  style=" margin: 150px auto 0;" >In the past, the cameras we had kept the images on film, which had to be replaced all the time and their development cost
            was expensive, which made people take few pictures, but invest a lot in photography today, our cameras keep the images on a digital memory device, which over the years Their
            price has been reduced and we have become an equal product for every person. As a result, people take many pictures without thought, which causes many images that are similar
            to each other, blurry images, etc ..., as well as many images that are stored in several different memory devices, which creates duplicates. We want to develop / save in a digital
            album. In order to solve the problem we set up our website, which automatically filters all duplicate and corrupted images, then sorts all similar images and lets the user select
            from the content the desired images.</br>Hope you enjoy our site
